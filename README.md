Current deep learning based tumor segmentation efforts are trained on highly-specialized datasets typically containing little variation in factors such as lesion types, medical institutions, and demographics. This specialized training limits the generalizability and robustness of the models, thereby reducing their potential for  translation to a clinical setting.  For this reason, we aim to create brain tumor segmentation algorithms capable of adapting and generalizing to different scenarios with little prior information or data on the target classes.
